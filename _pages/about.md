Iâ€™m an aspiring data scientist, experienced with Python and R. I specialize in machine learning, statistical analysis, and data visualization. 

From an early age, I had a fascination with mathematics. My love for math and statistics led me to earn a B.S. in Mathematics and a minor in Statistics from Arkansas State University. In May 2020, I graduated from the University of Central Arkansas with an M.S. in Applied Mathematics. Currently, I am living in Denver, CO while I search for a career that allows me to do the thing that I love: tell a story with data. 

In my free time, I enjoy hiking, running, playing ultimate frisbee, and eavesdropping at coffee shops. I have a two-year-old dog named Leo who accompanies me on my adventures.
